and white\nShe's got a mind of her own and she uses it well\nSo she invites me over outside Villanova\nShe's got some pull-out sofa that we won't hardly need\nShe is only drinking soda, revving up that motor\nGot places we could go to, but I still won't believe\n\nThat she's only gifted\nWhen I'm standing by her side\nShe goes unassisted\nAnd I start to relax as I cut her some slack\n\nCHORUS\nSo get up, I gotta go to work\nFacing all these people who now know I'm a jerk\nAnd it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes\nConcealing all this evidence before everybody knows\nWhat I've done and what I'm gonna do again\n\nAnd in the middle of the night\nI have a breakdown of sorts with regret creeping in\nShe's gonna put up a fight\nAnd she will get her way, cause she loves sleeping in\nSo I need someone to side with when she begins confiding\nAnd I cannot provide it cause I'm endlessly cold\nShe says she's so excited to play some groom and bride\nWith me but I'm undecided so I need to be told\n\nThat she's only sinking\nWhen I'm sleeping by her side\nWith a change of thinking\nI could pull us away even just for a day\n\nCHORUS\nSo get up, I gotta go to work\nFacing all these people who now know I'm a jerk\nAnd it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes\nConcealing all this evidence before everybody knows\nWhat I've done and what I'm gonna do again\n\nShe grows impatient to change my tune\nShe's getting older and legal soon\nAnd I wasn't ready to start out and go upsetting\nSome girl that I'd be forgetting\nBy the time the cops came by that afternoon\nAnd I try to decide as she pulls me aside\n\nCHORUS\nSo get up, I gotta go to work\nFacing all these people who now know I'm a jerk\nAnd it's a set-up, I gotta change my clothes\nConcealing all this evidence before everybody knows\nWhat I've done and what I'm gonna do

stronger than your pride\nThe trouble with love is\nIt doesn't care how fast you fall\nAnd you can't refuse the call\nSee you've got no say at all\nEverytime I turn around\nI think I've got it all figured out\nMy heart keeps callin and I keep on falling\nOver and over again\nThis sad story always ends the same\nMe standin in the pouring rain\nIt seems no matter what I do\nIt tears my heart in two\n(The trouble with love is)\nThe trouble with love is yea\n(It can tear you up inside)\nIt can tear you up inside\n(Make your heart believe a lie)\nMake your heart believe a lie\nIt's stronger

through your mind?\nHow is it that you made it?\nHow is it that you noticed?\nIt wasn't me who was looking at you\nThrough foggy glass or windows, it was them\n\nI was out in Coolidge with my head on a counter\nDrinking down my chances to ever return to anyone\nNo I wasn't faking it, the hurt I felt was real\nAnd all that was holy just slowly disappeared\nOr just appeared in parking lots of truck stops\nThe blinking lights, and now all I'm thinking is\n\"How the hell did I get here?\"\n\nDoes your husband know I call you sweetheart?\nDoes he know that I call you at all?\nIt's not like you are cheating we're only meeting\nIn hotels and not your home\nWould you change your last name to mine?\nI think my kids would mind\nI think my kids would mind\n\nI was in the desert waving planes and burning phone books\nTo a tune that was famous the year I was born\nDo not leave me dancing alone\nPick up the phone and call me lover\nSay come and get me I am home\nPlease pick up the phone\nPlease

bedroom door\nAnd let everything be as it was before\n\nFor the peace, for the peace, for the peace of all mankind\nWill you go away, will you go away, will you vanish from my mind\nWill you go away and close the bedroom door\nAnd let everything be as it was before\n\nDa-di-da, da-da-di, da-da-di-di-di-di-di\nWill you go away, will you go away, will you vanish from my mind\nWill you go away and

this\nWhat can I do to get you there\n\nThere's only so much I can take\nAnd I just got to let it go\nAnd who knows I might feel better, yeah\nIf I don't try and I don't hope\n\nWhat can I do to make you love me\nWhat can I do to make you care\nWhat can I say to make you feel this\nWhat can I do to get you there\n\nNo more waiting, no more, aching...\nNo more fighting, no more, trying...\n\nMaybe there's nothing more to say\nAnd in a funny way I'm calm\nBecause the power is not mine\nI'm just going to let it fly\n\nWhat can I do to make you love me\n(What can I do to make you love me)\nWhat can I do to make you care\n(What can I do to make you care)\nWhat can I say to make you feel this\n(What can I do to make you love me)\nWhat can I do to get you there\n(What can I do to make you care)\nWhat can I do to make you love me\n(What can I do to make you love me)\nWhat can I do to make you care\n(What can I do to make you care)\nWhat can I change to make you feel this\n(What can I do

is hold you\nThere's a racing within my heart\nAnd I am barely touching you\n\nTurn the lights down low\nTake it off\nLet me show\nMy love for you is\nInsatiable\nTurn me on\nNever stop\nWanna taste every drop\nMy love for you is\nInsatiable\n\nThe moonlight plays upon your skin\nA kiss that lingers takes me in\nI fall asleep inside of you\nThere are no words\nThere's only truth\nBreathe in, breathe out\nThere is no sound\nWe move together up and down\nWe levitate, our bodies soar\nOur feet don't even touch the floor\nAnd nobody knows you like I do\nCause the world, they don't understand\nBut I grow stronger in your hands\n\nTurn the lights down low\nTake it off\nLet me show\nMy love for you is\nInsatiable\nTurn me on\nNever stop\nWanna taste every drop\nMy love for you

up my mind\nI'll take a tragedy over a fairytale\nBut only when the sun is shining\nI'll be the voice of hope in your darkest hour\nI'm an expert in the silver lining\nI'll be there when you need me\nFor all the big things\nBut I'm really pathetic at perfect timing\nAnd that's the way it seems to go for me\nI go to bed at 8 and wake up at 4.30\nMost day I drink like a fish and tend to be too flirty\nI am a perfectionist but only when things get dirty\nI cannot stand small talk but I'm great at being wordy\nAnd I'd rather leave you first\nBut then I'll be begging you to come back\nAnd when I get real quiet\nYou know I'm about to attack\nI'll take a walk in the rain or a drive in the dark\nBut only when everyone's celebrating\nI'll dig in to your pain and tear it apart\nBut only to help the heart that's breaking\nI like to figure things out and make everything right\nBut I'm secretly thrilled when everything's changing\nAnd that's the way it seems to go for me\nIf you fall for the part that's brooding and dark\nYou will never discover the rest of my heart\nAnd I want you to see that there's so much to see\nJust before I declare you never knew me\nHe's with the small stuff like the world around was over\nI calm him down and we make breakfast for each other\nOur friends all thought we fit so perfectly together\nHe likes what he can't have and I sure like bad weather\nI may have left him first\nBut I think he'd been leaving for sometime\nI feel like begging him to come back\nBut I can't make up my mind\nI'll take a boxing match over the quiet night\nBut only to make for better dreams\nI'll back the underdog in any fight\nBut only to fight for something worth keeping\nI'm in it to win it, most of the time\nAnd if it goes down I'll be kicking and screaming\nAnd that's

before\nSo she got away here quick to find a better kick\n\nNever let it, wanna find her\nCan't forget it to remind her\nShe's my sister, wanna tell her\nHow I miss her, she told me\n\nWait 'til you

the rap game in a chokehold\nI'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind\nGot a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind\nNow shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow\nHer girlfriend
